Customer Behavior Analysis- APP users

Many companies have a mobile presence which provides free products/services in their mobile apps in an attempt to transition their customers to a paid membership. Some examples of paid products, which originate from free ones, are YouTube Red, Pandora Premium and Audible Subscription. Since marketing efforts are never free, these companies need to know who to target with offers and promotions.

Market: The target audience is customers who use a company’s free product. In this case study, this refers to users who installed and used the company’s free mobile app.

Product: The paid membership often provide enhanced versions of the free products already given for free, alongside new features. For example, YouTube Red allows you to leave the app while listening to a video.

Goal: The objective of this model is to predict which users will not subscribe to the paid membership, so that greater marketing efforts can go into trying to “convert” them to paid users.

BUSINESS CHALLENGE
In this project, a fintech company wants to provide its customers with a paid mobile app subscription that will allow them to track all their finances in one place. To attract customers, the company release a free version of their app with some of the main features unlocked.
The main task is to identify which users will most likely not enroll in the paid product, so that additional offers can be given to them. Because of the cost of these offers, the company does not want to offer them to everybody, especially to customers who were going to enroll anyways.

DATASET
Dataset is the customers’ app behavior data, which allows to see the data and time of app installation, as well as the features the users engaged with within the app. App behavior is characterized as the list of app screens the user looked at and whether the user played the financial mini games available. 
The app usage data is only from the user’s first day in the app. The limitation exists because users can enjoy a 24-hour free trial of the premium features, and the company wants to target them with new offers shortly after the trial is over.
